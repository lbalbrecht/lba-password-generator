# lba-password-generator-homework

## User Story
The user is looking for a password generator that will allow them to choose which characters to include in the password
The categories of characters available are lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
The password must be between 8 and 128 characters long

## Usage
When the user clicks the "Generate password" button, they will be presented with a number of popup windows
The first will be a prompt instructing the user to define the length of their password. If the user does not input a valid response (i.e. a number between 8 and 128), the window will close and the user will have to start again
Once the password length has been defined, the user will select which characters they would like included in the password from the four categories listed above. If no characters are chosen, then the function will close and the user will have to restart
After all prompts are answered, the page will generate a password based on the criteria defined by the user's input.
